Linux Device Driver Tutorials

Welcome! üëã This repository is a collection of simple, hands-on tutorials for learning Linux device driver development. Each directory contains a self-contained C program and Makefile demonstrating a specific, fundamental concept of kernel module programming.

This collection is perfect for students, hobbyists, and developers who are new to kernel development and want practical examples to build upon.

üìö Tutorials Included

Here's a breakdown of the concepts covered in each directory:

    simple_driver: A foundational "Hello, World!" kernel module. The perfect starting point to verify your build environment.

    passing_arguments_to_linux_device_drivers: Demonstrates how to pass parameters to a module at load time using module_param.

    character_device_driver_statically: Shows how to create a character device driver by statically requesting a specific major and minor number.

    character_device_driver_dynamically: Implements the preferred method for creating a character device driver by dynamically allocating a major number from the kernel.

    device_file_creation_for_character_drivers: Explains how to automatically create and destroy device files in /dev using class_create and device_create.

    cdev_structure_and_file_operations: A deeper dive into character drivers, showing how to register file operations (open, read, write, close) using the cdev structure.

    system_calls: An example related to system call handling or interaction from within the kernel.

    semaphore: A tutorial on using semaphores for synchronization to prevent race conditions in your driver.

    shared_memory: An example demonstrating an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.

    message_queue: Another example of an IPC mechanism used within the kernel.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your Linux system:

    A Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, or a Virtual Machine).

    The build-essential package (or equivalent) for make and gcc.

    The Linux kernel headers corresponding to your running kernel.

You can typically install the necessary packages with a single command:
Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)

üöÄ How to Build and Run a Tutorial

The process is the same for each tutorial directory.

    Navigate to a Tutorial Directory Choose a tutorial you'd like to run. For example, to start with the basic driver:
    Bash

cd simple_driver

Build the Kernel Module Each directory contains a Makefile. Simply run the make command to compile the C source file into a kernel module (.ko file).
Bash

make

Load the Module Use the insmod command with sudo to insert the compiled module into the kernel.
Bash

sudo insmod simple_driver.ko

Check the Kernel Log View the output from the driver (messages printed with printk) using the dmesg command.
Bash

dmesg | tail

You should see the "Hello, World!" message from the driver's init function.

Unload the Module When you are finished, remove the module from the kernel using the rmmod command.
Bash

sudo rmmod simple_driver

Check dmesg again to see the message from the driver's exit functio
